The setup has extracted the library files into $INSTALL_PATH directory.

On Windows
Do add "$INSTALL_PATH\dist\QuickServer.jar" file to the CLASSPATH
Do add "$INSTALL_PATH\bin" to the PATH

On Unix
Do add "$INSTALL_PATH/dist/QuickServer.jar" file to the CLASSPATH
Do add "$INSTALL_PATH/bin" to the PATH


Note: You need not add commons-collections.jar, commons-beanutils.jar,
commons-digester.jar, commons-logging.jar, commons-pool.jar since 
QuickServer.jar will directly use it from its directory.



When deploying or running your server application on a production system do 
use the -server option while invoking java command.

Eg:

java -server -jar dist/QuickServer.jar -load conf/SomeServer.xml
