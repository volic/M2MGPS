Introduction
---------------------
QuickServer is an open source Java library/framework for quick creation 
of robust multi-client TCP server applications. With QuickServer you can 
concentrate on just the application logic/protocol on hand.  

QuickServer provides an abstraction over the ServerSocket, Socket and 
other network and input output classes and it eases the creation of 
powerful network servers.

Example programs demonstrating the use of the library can be found 
with the QuickServer distribution  [examples folder]. 
Latest examples, documentation is available through the website. 


Brief Architecture
---------------------
QuickServer divides the application logic of its developer over eight 
main classes,
	* ClientEventHandler [Optional Class]
		Handles client events.
	* ClientCommandHandler [#]
		Handles client interaction - Character/String commands.
	* ClientObjectHandler [#]
		Handles client interaction - Java Object commands.
	* ClientBinaryHandler [#]
		Handles client interaction - Binary data (byte array).
	* ClientWriteHandler [Optional Class]
		Handles client write operation - Non-Blocking Mode.
	* ClientAuthenticationHandler [Optional Class]
		Used to authenticate a client.
	* ClientData [Optional Class]
		Client data carrier (support class)
	* ClientExtendedEventHandler [Optional Class]
		Handles extended client events.

[#] = Any one of these have to be set based on default DataMode for input. 
      The default DataMode for input is String so if not changes you will
      have to set ClientCommandHandler.

See the architecture.pdf for basic architecture of QuickServer.


Major Features
---------------------
 * Create multi-client TCP server applications.
 * Support for secure server creations: SSL, TLS
 * Support for thread per client (multi-threaded) - Blocking Mode.
 * Support for non-blocking input output - Non-Blocking Mode.
 * Clear separation of server, protocol and authentication logic.
 * Remote administration support: QsAdminServer 
   (With support for plugable application commands)
 * Support for command shell for local administration of server.
 * GUI based remote administration: QsAdminGUI 
   (With support for gui plug-ins)
 * Restart or Suspend the server without killing connected clients.
 * Inbuilt pools for reusing of threads and most used Objects.
 * Full logging support [Java built in Logging].
 * Support for sending and receiving Strings, Bytes, Binary and 
   serialized java objects.
 * Support for identifying and searching clients. 
 * Support for xml configuration with ability to store application 
   specific data in the same xml.
 * Support for xml based JDBC mapping.
 * Support for Service Configurator pattern.
 * Support for restricting access to server by ip address.
 * Support for loading/reloading application jar from xml.
 * Ability to add process hooks into QuickServer.
 * Ability to specify maximum number of clients allowed.
 * Support for negotiating secure connection over normal tcp connection.
 * Nice and easy examples come with the distribution - FTPServer, 
   CmdServer, EchoWebServer, ChatServer, SecureEchoWebServer, XmlAdder, 
   PipeServer, Filesrv.


What's New in 1.4.7
---------------------
 * Implemented support NIO writes in sendClientXXX methods of ClientHandler.
 * Added initServer() method that throws AppException if it fails.
 * Added getServiceError() to Service.
 * Added load() method to QuickServer that loads the server from the xml file.
 * Improved ByteBufferInputStream for readLine.
 * Improved BasicClientHandler, NonBlockingClientHandler.
 * Improved setClassLoader() in QuickServer.
 * GhostSocketReaper now will close pools after last client disconnects 
   after server is stopped.
 * Many more bug fixes and enhancements.
